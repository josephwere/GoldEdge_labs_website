## Docker (Local Hybrid Dev)

Start services locally (Mongo, Redis, Backend, Frontend):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Admin seeding: the docker compose file seeds an admin user from `.env.docker.example` values.

**Admin (demo)**
- email: josephogwe8@gmail.com
- password: Josboy@254

> ⚠️ Security: The admin credentials are included for local development convenience. **Do not** commit real secrets to public repositories. Replace these credentials in production and use secure secret management.
